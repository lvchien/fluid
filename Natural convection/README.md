# Numerical scheme for natural convection problems
In this paper, we propose a numerical scheme for natural convection problem based on the method of characteristics and finite element. Our approach regards the motion of an incompressible viscous fluid governed by Navier-Stokes equations due to thermal effects. The unconditional stability analysis and the error analysis with convergence order are given. Some numerical test cases on analytical solution, driven cavity flow,... are investigated to assess the solver. The programs are written in FreeFem++ using the Finite Element method.

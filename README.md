# Fluid simulation
This project is an implementation of the numerical schemes for fluid problems, such as Navier-Stokes equation and natural convection equation with Freefem++ using finite element method (FEM).

#### Freefem++ installation
First, you must install recent Freefem++, see http://www.freefem.org/ff++/. This program was written with version Freefem++ 3.47.
